This is clone version of the popular word game 'Wordle' by NYTimes. It uses different algorithm to choose daily words, which is the motivation to build this. Actually, the word list of original wordle is usually leaked on twitter and it already shows which word will be there on the day. So overcoming that problem I built this wordle which will choose the word which nobody can know and it will be decided randomly by the code at 12:00:00 everyday. It is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

If you are also troubled by this leaks which spoils our fun, checkout my wordle clone [here](https://wordle766.netlify.app/).
