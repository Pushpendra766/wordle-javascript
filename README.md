This is clone version of the popular word game 'Wordle' by NYTimes. It uses a different algorithm to choose daily words, which is the motivation to build this. Actually, the word list of original wordle usually gets leaked on twitter and it already shows which word will be there on the day. So overcoming that problem I built this wordle which will choose the word which nobody can know and it will be decided randomly by the code at 12:00:00 everyday. It is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If you are also troubled by this leaks which spoils our fun, checkout my wordle clone [here](https://wordle766.netlify.app/).

# How to play ?
As you open the game website you will see a popup, which will show how to play and rules. 
Briefly explaining, we have to guess a 5 letter word, in order for us to do that the game will give us some hint on every valid 5 letter word entered by us and like that we have to guess the word for that day.
